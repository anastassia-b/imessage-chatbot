# imessage-rnn

In-progress project: Building a neural network to learn my style of speaking, and respond to texts accordingly!

### Technologies

* Training messages obtained with **SQL**
* Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) built with **TensorFlow**
* **Flask** app responds with generated messages
* **Twilio SMS** webhook
* Deployed through **AWS**.

### Next Steps

* Increase training data
* Improve RNN performance with LSTM cells
* Automated Testing, Continuous Integration
* Build web app version as well
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
